# test-sdk

// TODO(user): A simple overview of the project and its purpose.

## Description

// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph providing more details about the project and its use.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes and optionally a kcp cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on Kubernetes or kcp

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `REGISTRY` and `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push REGISTRY=<some-registry> IMG=test-sdk:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `REGISTRY` and `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy REGISTRY=<some-registry> IMG=test-sdk:tag
```

### Uninstall resources

To delete the resources from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached. 

### Test It Out

1. Install the required resources into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, regenerate the manifests using:

```sh
make manifests apiresourceschemas
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
